## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to leverage historical data on **UberEats deliveries** to develop a forecasting model that can predict future demand. By analyzing patterns and trends in the historical data, we aim to generate **accurate forecasts** for the number of delivery requests expected in the future.

The **dataset** used for this project contains information such as the date, hour, number of requests received, number of requests completed, number of hours drivers were on duty, number of hours drivers were on trip, predicted ETA, actual ETA, number of delivered products, and total products available. These variables provide valuable insights into the **demand patterns** and various factors influencing delivery services.

The dataset contains **comprehensive data** about UberEats deliveries over a period of one month, with distinct information for three different time periods each day: 11:00, 12:00 and 13:00.
Upon thorough analysis of the dataset, it has been determined that the time period with the **highest number** of deliveries is at `12:00`, indicating a peak in demand during that particular hour. This finding suggests that customers are more inclined to place UberEats orders around midday, possibly due to lunchtime preferences or convenience.

Furthermore, the data reveals the days of the week with the highest delivery volumes in descending order. 
The analysis demonstrates that ``Saturday`` has the highest number of deliveries, followed by Sunday, Monday, Friday, Thursday, Wednesday, and Tuesday. This ranking provides valuable insights into the weekly **delivery patterns**, allowing businesses to allocate resources effectively and optimize their operations accordingly.
