## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to leverage historical data on **UberEats deliveries** to develop a forecasting model that can predict future demand. By analyzing patterns and trends in the historical data, we aim to generate **accurate forecasts** for the number of delivery requests expected in the future.

The **dataset** used for this project contains information such as the date, hour, number of requests received, number of requests completed, number of hours drivers were on duty, number of hours drivers were on trip, predicted ETA, actual ETA, number of delivered products, and total products available. These variables provide valuable insights into the **demand patterns** and various factors influencing delivery services.
